## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most joyful code I'm happy to learn is the css before. 



```css
.overlay{
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(277, 64%, 61%), hsl(277, 64%, 61%)) ;
}
}
```

### Continued development

I look forward to be perfect with the use of flexbox, box-model, Media query.

### Useful resources

- [Cover Overlay](https://www.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJZtmD3H9Sc) - This helped me for the color overlay on the image. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
